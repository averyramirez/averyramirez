## Hey there, I'm Avery! :wave: 

### About me:
:sun_with_face: I'm a web developer located in San Diego, CA who is learning a little bit more every day! Even though I had no idea what I was doing at the time, I enjoyed coding HTML and CSS for my social media sites in the late 2000s. It wasn't until a decade later that I decided I needed a life change and began to study coding! I'll be updating this profile with all of the projects from my bootcamp and any fun things I do on the side.
